What is HTTP? 
	Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, a standard for sending and retrieving data from a server
What is a URL? 
	Uniform Resource Locator, used to locate a resource on the web
What is DNS? 
	Domain Name Service, it essentially sets an alias for ip addresses to something we as humans can remember more easily
What is a query string? 
	Something typically appended to get requests in key value pairs 
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? 
	GET=get data from server, POST=send data to server
What is an HTTP request? 
	A request from the client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol
What is an HTTP response? 
	A response to the request following the HTTP protocol
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
	Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
	Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
	Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
	Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
	Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
	The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
	The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
	The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
